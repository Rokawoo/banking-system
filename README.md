## What is Banking System?
Banking System is a robust banking system that offers a variety of account types, automatic APR calculation, and comprehensive error handling. Built with Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, it ensures a high level of reliability and maintainability. The system incorporates modular design with separate classes for account management, transaction processing, and passtime features.

### Features:
- **Account Transactions**: Allows transactions between accounts using unique account IDs.
- **APR Calculation**: Automatically calculate the Annual Percentage Rate for different types of accounts.
- **Account Types**: Supports savings, checking, and other custom account types.
- **Passtime Feature**: Simulate the passage of time for testing purposes, allowing you to see how account balances change over time.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure that transactions and operations are performed safely and accurately to specification.
- **Modular Design**: Classes that handle different aspects of the system, promoting a clean and scalable codebase.
- **Built with TDD**: Developed using Test-Driven Development, with a comprehensive test suite ensuring system stability.


### Testing
- **Extensive Mutation Testing**
- **Test Classes**
